				<h3>Our History</h3>
				<p>
					The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006
					by three visionary women in Boston, Massachussets: Atsuko Toko Fish,
					Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women
					leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Jpan to Boston to recieve
					four weeks of hands-on expereince and training with succesful
					nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and leadership
					developers. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an
					Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their
					dreams of social change reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows
					are expected to make a difference in their communities based on their
					Action Plans. The purpose of this program is for the fellows to share
					the knowledge and expereince they acquired in Boston with other women
					and socual sector leaders with Japan.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other
					Boston-Based nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in
					partnership with Simmons College School of Management's Center for
					Gender in Orginizations.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S- Japan
					Foundation, JWLI expaned its vision to hold public forums with Japan.
					Held in 2010, 2012 and 2013, these public forums provided information
					about the nonprofit sector and the American approach to philanthropy
					with hopes to inspire women to take leadership roles. The Forum
					Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens, advocating for their
					involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society
