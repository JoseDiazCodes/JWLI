## Deep Dive into CSS Through JWLI

The creation of the JWLI static website greatly enriched my CSS knowledge, especially in areas like:

The core of this project revolved around mastering the `float` property. It proved invaluable for crafting side-by-side content layouts and intricate designs.

### 2. **Box Model & Layout**:

The CSS box model was integral to this project. By harnessing properties like `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `width`, a harmonious layout was achieved.
